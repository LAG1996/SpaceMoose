# Space Moose

Welcome to the repository for Space Moose. This was a prototype I worked on with a couple of other Computer Science students during the Spring 2016 Introduction to Game Development course at The University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley.

Space Moose is a platformer/shooter. The prototype features one boss that the player must defeat to win. The boss escalates in difficulty as its health goes down, so watch out!

## How to Play

Make sure you have a 32-bit version of pygame installed in your machine. Then just run ``SpaceMoose2.py``.

Artwork and Animations were done by an art student at UTRGV who was gracious enough to sit through our meetings, where we talked a lot more about code than actual art!

## Side Note

I thought this code was lost, but it's been preserved for all this time in some SVN repo, hidden in darkness. This project was developed for the same class as [Fireball](https://github.com/LAG1996/FireballGame).
