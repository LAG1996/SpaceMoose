# Space Moose

Welcome to the repository for Space Moose. This was a prototype I worked on with a couple of other Computer Science students during the Spring 2016 Introduction to Game Development course at The University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley.

Space Moose is a platformer/shooter. The prototype features one boss that the player must defeat to win. The boss escalates in difficulty as its health goes down, so watch out!

## How to Play

Make sure you have a 32-bit version of pygame installed in your machine. Then just run ``SpaceMoose2.py``.
